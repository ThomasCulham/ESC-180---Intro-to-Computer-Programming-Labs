LOL, or lol, is an initialism for laugh(ing) out loud[1][2][3] 
and a popular element of Internet slang. It was first used almost 
exclusively on Usenet, but has since become widespread in other 
forms of computer-mediated communication and even face-to-face 
communication. It is one of many initialisms for expressing 
bodily reactions, in particular laughter, as text, including 
initialisms for more emphatic expressions of laughter such as 
LMAO[4] ("laugh(ing) my ass off") and ROFL[5][6][7] or ROTFL[8][9] 
("roll(ing) on the floor laughing"). Other unrelated expansions 
include the now mostly obsolete "lots of luck" or "lots of love" 
used in letter-writing.[10]. The list of acronyms "grows by the 
month" (said Peter Hershock in 2003),[6] and they are collected 
along with emoticons and smileys into folk dictionaries that are 
circulated informally amongst users of Usenet (lollery), IRC, and 
other forms of (textual) computer-mediated communication.[11] These 
initialisms are controversial, and several authors[12][13][14][15] 
recommend against their use, either in general or in specific 
contexts such as business communications. The Oxford English 
Dictionary first listed LOL in March, 2011.[16]
